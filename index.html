      Hi, to you 831 but you didn't return that number with the number I expected because
      it seems like I'm not your favourite that I know from the incident at that time. Hopefully you'll meet a
      a guy who loves you more than I love you so that you can always smile and be happy while you're a doctor.
     
      <br><br>
      And you know who sent this to your email from the news of someone your friend who went to Germany from his university. And here, too, is a 
      girl who seems to have forgotten you forever. But I will always remember your name forever Jo.
